# oneko - MODDED

this mod is **not affiliated to adryd325 or vending.machine**, its just a little project i wanted to do so i can dive into the way javascript is made.

### THIS MOD ONLY WORKS FOR WINDOWS USERS. i will find out how to use on mac aswell in some time.

if you want a custom version of oneko, see the requirements [here.](https://github.com/renzz00/oneko-modded/blob/main/misc/custom-oneko.md)
# how to install oneko modded

before you start rambling about how it dosent work, **YOU NEED TO ENABLE ONEKO IN VENCORD PLUGINS BEFORE THIS.**

* to install, you need to go into the renderer.js file inside of your Vencord installation. If you cannot find it, try going to your vencord installation, then dist, then open it inside of a code editor like vs code, or notepad if you do not have one.

* next, use ctrl+f to bring up the search menu. inside of it, type oneko. near some of the oneko names, you should find this link: **https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adryd325/oneko.js/8fa8a1864aa71cd7a794d58bc139e755e96a236c/oneko.js**

* next, replace that link with the mod of your choice [here.](https://github.com/renzz00/oneko-modded/blob/main/misc/links.md) then save the new js file as renderer.js

* for the last step, restart discord with ctrl+r

### DONE!
