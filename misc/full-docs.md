## how to install oneko modded script

* to install, you need to go into the renderer.js file inside of your vencord installation. if you cannot find it, try going to your vencord installation, then dist, then open it inside of a code editor like vs code, or notepad if you do not have one.

* next, use ctrl+f to bring up the search menu. inside of it, type oneko. near some of the oneko names, you should find this link: **https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adryd325/oneko.js/8fa8a1864aa71cd7a794d58bc139e755e96a236c/oneko.js**

* next, replace that link with the mod of your choice [here.](https://github.com/renzz00/oneko-modded/blob/main/misc/links.md) then save the new js file as renderer.js

* for the last step, restart discord with ctrl+r

* to install custom themes, find the renderer.js file inside of your vencord installation. if you cannot find it, try going to your vencord installation, then dist, then open it inside of a code editor like vs code, or notepad if you do not have one.

* next, use ctrl+f to bring up the search menu, and search for oneko. once you find it, there should be 2 links. we are looking for this one: **https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adryd325/oneko.js/14bab15a755d0e35cd4ae19c931d96d306f99f42/oneko.gif**

* after, replace that with one of the custom preset links [here](https://github.com/renzz00/oneko-modded/blob/main/presets/preset-links.md) and save the new file as renderer.js in the same "dist" folder.
